# Eskel

Eskel was a witcher of the School of the Wolf taught by Master Vesemir at Kaer Morhen and active in the 13th century. 
As the sorceress Triss Merigold noticed, Eskel emanated a strong magic aura. 
Though less famous than his peer Geralt of Rivia, Eskel became renowned in his own right as a professional, 
reliable witcher, and possessing a kind and relaxed disposition.

Eskel and the White Wolf were like brothers. 
Side by side they grew up, enjoyed pastime activities and endured the witcher trials. 
A good friend of younger Lambert and CoÃ«n of Poviss, Eskel saw Vesemir as both a mentor and a father figure. 
He returned to Kaer Morhen each winter to swap tales and rejuvenate for The Path.
